# 2DOF-Robot-Arm
A Robot arm to help with holding things when soldering, or to automate picking things up and sorting them, and is adjusted using buttons. It uses 2 SG90 servos and 1 MG996R servo, allowing it to pick up decently heavy things without dropping them. Its powered from a 3.7V Lipo so uses a voltage step up which is the MT3608, and the servo controller PCA9685.

BOM:
1x 3.7V LiPo
1x 3.7v LiPo Charger (USB-C)
1x PCA9685
1x MT3608
2x SG90
1x MG996R
2x 3D-Printed Arm Segments
1x 3D-Printed Base
Customisable attachments for the end of the arm, so could be a magnet, a clip on for a soldering iron, or anything not too heavy, and uses a servo if it should be a gripping device that is able to close and be general purpose.
