# 2DOF-Robot-Arm
A Robot arm to help with holding things when soldering, or to automate picking things up and sorting them, and is adjusted using buttons. It uses 2 SG90 servos and 1 MG996R servo, allowing it to pick up decently heavy things without dropping them. Its powered from a 3.7V Lipo so uses a voltage step up which is the MT3608, and the servo controller PCA9685.

For the necessary parts, look in BOM.csv
In addition to the BOM you can make customisable attachments for the end of the arm, so could be a magnet, a clip on for a soldering iron, or anything not too heavy, and uses a servo if it should be a gripping device that is able to close and be general purpose.
